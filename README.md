## Introduction

In 2002, The Cornell Lab or Ornithology and National Audubon Society launched the eBird project â€“ a real-time, online checklist to collect bird observations submitted by the public. In its first decade, eBird participation has grown dramatically with tens of millions of observations now submitted each year. The project has not only revolutionized the way that the ornithological community reports and accesses information about birds, it has also become one of the largest databases of biodiversity information in the world.

As an increasingly successful citizen science project, eBird has just as much to teach us about publicly-derived data collection as it does about birds. This project focuses on mapping patterns of eBird participation to develop best practices for visualizing the spatial and temporal quality and quantity of submitted data. By sharing data coverage information with the public in a cartographically clear manner, we can enhance understanding of the project and improve the utility of the dataset by inspiring participants to collect more data in poorly covered areas. While this project focuses specifically on visualizing eBird data coverage, the work has broader applications for improving how any crowd-sourced data collection project educates its participants.
